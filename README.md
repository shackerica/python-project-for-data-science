# Tesla and GameStop Stock Analysis

In this project, I'm demonstrating my proficiency in Python by showcasing my skills in data extraction, manipulation, and visualization. It's all about tackling different challenges presented in the IBM Python course assignment. From pulling data from Yahoo Finance API to scraping revenue information from the web, and even crafting engaging interactive dashboards, I'm diving into various aspects of Python to showcase what I've learned.

## Data Extraction

- **Tesla Stock**: Utilized the yfinance library to extract historical stock data, including open, high, low, close, adjusted close, and volume.
- **GameStop Stock**: Employed yfinance library for GameStop's historical stock data, capturing similar details.
- **Revenue Data**: Utilized BeautifulSoup for web scraping to extract revenue data for both Tesla and GameStop.

## Analysis

- **Price Trends**: Analyzed stock price movements over time to identify patterns and trading opportunities.
- **Volatility Assessment**: Evaluated stock volatility to understand associated risks.
- **Performance Comparison**: Compared Tesla and GameStop stock performance against each other or market indices.

## Visualization

- I used the `make_graph` function to generate visualizations depicting the stock performance of Tesla and GameStop. Each visualization showcased the closing prices of the stocks over time, coupled with revenue data, and was titled with the corresponding stock name.

## Conclusion

This analysis aims to provide insights into Tesla and GameStop stock performance, aided by data extraction techniques using yfinance for stock data and BeautifulSoup for revenue data. These insights can assist investors and analysts in their decision-making processes.
